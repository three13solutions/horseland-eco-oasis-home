# Multi-Category Support & Auto-Detection Update

## ✅ Changes Completed

### 1. Database Schema Changes

**New Junction Table: `image_categories`**
- Created many-to-many relationship table
- Allows one image to belong to multiple categories
- **No file duplication** - same image file can appear in multiple categories
- Migrated all existing category associations from `gallery_images.category_id`

**Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE image_categories (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  image_id UUID REFERENCES gallery_images(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  category_id UUID REFERENCES gallery_categories(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  UNIQUE(image_id, category_id)
);
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ One image → Multiple categories
- ✅ No duplicate uploads
- ✅ Efficient storage
- ✅ Easy to add/remove category associations

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### **Multi-Category Checkbox Selection**

**Before:**
- Dropdown to select ONE category
- Had to upload same image multiple times for different categories

**After:**
- Checkbox grid to select MULTIPLE categories
- Same image file appears in all selected categories
- No duplication needed

#### **Auto-Detection of Media Type**

**Before:**
- Manual toggle buttons to switch between Image/Video
- User had to tell the system what type of media

**After:**
- **Automatic detection** based on:
  - Image uploads → Detects as `image`
  - URLs containing youtube/vimeo/mp4/webm → Detects as `video`
  - No toggle buttons needed!
- Shows detected type as a badge with source type

**Detection Logic:**
```typescript
const videoIndicators = ['youtube.com', 'youtu.be', 'vimeo.com', '.mp4', '.webm', '.ogg'];
const isVideo = videoIndicators.some(indicator => url.toLowerCase().includes(indicator));
```

## How It Works Now

### Adding/Editing Media

1. **Upload or paste URL** → System auto-detects if it's an image or video
2. **Select categories** → Check multiple boxes (e.g., "Gallery", "Rooms", "Activities")
3. **Save** → Image is associated with all selected categories
4. **Result** → Same image appears in all selected category views

### Example Use Case

**Scenario:** You have a beautiful sunset photo from the pool area

**Before (Old System):**
- Upload to "Gallery" category
- Want it in "Pool" category too? → Upload again (duplicate file)
- Want it in "Featured" too? → Upload a third time (3 copies!)

**After (New System):**
- Upload once
- Check boxes: ☑️ Gallery, ☑️ Pool, ☑️ Featured
- Save
- Result: 1 file, 3 category associations, no duplication

## Technical Details

### Junction Table Query Pattern

**Fetching images with categories:**
```sql
SELECT 
  gallery_images.*,
  image_categories.category_id,
  gallery_categories.name
FROM gallery_images
LEFT JOIN image_categories ON gallery_images.id = image_categories.image_id
LEFT JOIN gallery_categories ON image_categories.category_id = gallery_categories.id
```

**Filtering by category:**
```sql
-- Get all images in "Gallery" category
SELECT image_id FROM image_categories 
WHERE category_id = 'gallery-uuid'
```

### Category Management

**Add categories to image:**
```typescript
const categoryInserts = category_ids.map(catId => ({
  image_id: image.id,
  category_id: catId
}));

await supabase.from('image_categories').insert(categoryInserts);
```

**Update categories (replace all):**
```typescript
// 1. Delete existing
await supabase.from('image_categories')
  .delete()
  .eq('image_id', image.id);

// 2. Insert new
await supabase.from('image_categories')
  .insert(categoryInserts);
```

## Migration Notes

**Existing Data:**
- All existing `gallery_images.category_id` values were migrated to `image_categories` table
- Old `category_id` column kept for backward compatibility (can be removed later if needed)
- No data loss, all associations preserved

**RLS Policies:**
- Same security model applies
- Admins can manage associations
- Public can view associations
- Proper cascade deletes configured

---

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Primary Category**: Designate one category as "primary" for default display
2. **Category Order**: Order categories per image (e.g., show in Gallery first, then Pool)
3. **Smart Suggestions**: Suggest categories based on image content/tags
4. **Bulk Operations**: Add/remove categories for multiple images at once
5. **Category Hierarchy**: Parent/child categories for better organization

## Testing Checklist

- ✅ Create new image with multiple categories
- ✅ Edit image to add/remove categories
- ✅ Verify image appears in all selected category views
- ✅ Delete image → All category associations removed (cascade)
- ✅ Auto-detection works for images
- ✅ Auto-detection works for video URLs
- ✅ Source type auto-detected (upload vs external)
- ✅ Existing images still work with migrated data

## Questions Answered

**Q: Can the same image be in multiple categories now?**
A: ✅ Yes! Check multiple category boxes when adding/editing.

**Q: Do I need to upload the same image multiple times?**
A: ❌ No! Upload once, select multiple categories.

**Q: How does the system know if it's an image or video?**
A: 🤖 Auto-detected from file type or URL (youtube/vimeo = video, everything else = image).

**Q: What if I need to remove an image from one category but keep it in others?**
A: 📝 Edit the image, uncheck the category you want to remove, save. The image file stays but category association is removed.

**Q: What happens if I delete an image?**
A: 🗑️ The image file AND all category associations are deleted (cascade delete).
